            <div>
                <p class="temp-content" style="font-style:italic;">This essay was written about <a class="body-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailytarheel.com/blog/view-from-the-hill/2013/11/asg-an-animated-preview">Flash animation I completed in November 2013</a>, during my first year of college. I later won first place in the state for Best Multimedia Package from the N.C. College Media Association. Although the project isn't advanced enough to have a spot in my portfolio, it is what led me to pursue interactive programming. </p>
                <p class="temp-content">Journalism was at first to me an excuse to write, and investigate curiosities, and write more.</p>

<p class="temp-content">But during my first year of college, I was a political reporter for the Daily Tar Heel, and I learned that writing wasn’t the only tool at my disposal for storytelling. That in fact, for certain stories, merely writing about it wasn’t strong enough to get readers’ attentions.</p>

<p class="temp-content">My first semester I was assigned a beat for the Association of Student Governments — essentially a mini Board of Governors composed of student leaders in the UNC system. Every second Saturday of the month I would travel to a different school and sit in on six-hour-long meetings that started to blur together.</p> 

<p class="temp-content">At one point I was sitting in the office writing another “meeting story,” trying to take a different angle on it, and realizing that if I wasn’t the one writing this, there’s no way I would read it. With an election coming up that would determine the University’s standing with the Association, I wanted to reach out to as many students as I could to inform them before the vote.</p>

<p class="temp-content">So I worked through the night, teaching myself Adobe Flash, writing a script and creating graphics for an animation that I’d hoped would grab the attention of our readers.</p> 

<p class="temp-content">When I showed the animation to my editor the next morning, the results were immediate and powerful. The newsroom was abuzz: a reporter stepping out of the writing realm? Making? Online? Things?</p>

<p class="temp-content">It was perhaps expected that my story didn’t get a lot of views, and voter turnout was just about as low as was expected. I was too fresh into the realm of interactive graphics to know what I was doing. (I used Flash, which probably says enough about my knowledge of such things at the time).</p>

<p class="temp-content">And so I knew what I had to do. I started taking design and coding classes through the J School and the Computer Science department. The people I met had the same goal that I did: to figure out how to revolutionize the traditional daily paper digitally.</p> 

<p class="temp-content">At the DTH, in other small papers, and even in reporting classes, we’re still struggling against a culture that has built a wall between the reporters and the designers, photographers, and those of us who are “web people.”</p>

<p class="temp-content">But I know, from the classes I’ve taken and the conferences I’ve gone to and the experiences I’ve had, that we need not new stories, but new mediums to tell those stories that need to be heard.</p>
